# Intervallo - Lessions Learned

## Introduction

### Why Basic?

The Hungarian Commodore Plus/4 FB-group 
has announced a competition for 
creating games 
in three categories: 
basic, mixed and pure machine code. 
I was already planning to 
make something 
for my 
[*home platform*](http://plus4world.powweb.com/members/ern0), 
so I thought I'd enter.

I knew I wouldn't have enough time 
to make a complete game 
with graphics, music etc., 
so I wanted something simple.

I started programming - in Basic -
at the age of 13, 
and two years later, 
when I got my first computer,
a Commodore 16, 
I wrote some games for it, 
first in Basic:

- Dave's Little Car (cca. 1985, lost),
- [Music Helicopter 
  (1986)](http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Music_Helicopter) and
- [Asteroid (1987,
  with Ákos Nausch)](http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Asteroid)

Later I switched to 
Assembly programming,
made two music editors, 
and created  
some songs with them, 
which made me kinda famous 
in the early C16/Plus4 scene.

It has been *35 years* since 
my last Basic game.

> **What if I wrote the game in Basic
for the competition? After 35 years?**

Of course, 
the project smells of nostalgia, 
it would be a lie to deny it. 
Time travel to my teenage years, 
no doubt.

But there will be lessons learned. 
Decades have passed since then, 
which - 
in this profession, 
where a new era comes every 
few years - 
is a very, very long time.
Hardware, 
programming and languages,
software development methodologies 
have all undergone 
revolutionary changes. 

I've changed too, 
from an 
enthusiastic autodidact 
gifted amateur kid  
to an 
enthusiastic autodidact
slightly-better-than-average 
professional software developer.
